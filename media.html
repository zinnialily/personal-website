    the whole show is about the importance of balance. even starting off, it's about the 4 nations that once lived in balance, with aang only being able to access the avatar state in balance. the character arcs, like tophs, have to balance freedom and communal responsibility. we first see her in the 2 extremes of being isolated at home with no power and then being a "selfish" fighter. this causes problems when she first joins the gang, but we see her balance it over time.

    my thoughts on icarus's tale: Yes, he was smiling as he fell. But, at the end of the day, it is still a tragedy. Not because he wanted to reach the sun, that is normal and good and achieving, but because he was stupid about it. He knew that the wings were made from wax and that they wouldn’t hold up. He was reckless in his pursuit, not thinking clearly or being logical. Yes, maybe those specific wings wouldn’t let him reach the sun and that’s okay. He could have survived and escaped and then made his own stronger, better wings. Ones that wouldn’t melt beautifully under the scorching sun. It’s not a tragedy he wanted to reach the sun, but rather his method of pursuing it. We crave the irrationality of his actions, we are consumed with joy even if our stupid decisions fail. The idea of high highs and low lows and instability speaks to us on a rebellious level. But it’s never the best choice to let the recklessness consume us, as it will end in us falling, even us falling beautifully, speaks through the fire. We have still fallen unless we make our wings better and stronger.
